Following these guidelines ensures consistency across all documentation.\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\nThe style guide serves multiple purposes:\\n\\n- Ensures consistency in tone, voice, and formatting\\n- Makes documentation easier to read and understand\\n- Simplifies the process of writing and editing documentation\\n- Helps maintain a professional appearance\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nTo start using the style guide, familiarize yourself with the following sections:\\n\\n- [Writing Rules](/docs/style-guide/writing-rules) - Guidelines for language, tone, and structure\\n- [Formatting](/docs/style-guide/formatting) - Standards for markdown formatting, code blocks, and images\\n- [Microsoft Style](/docs/style-guide/microsoft-style) - Guidelines based on the Microsoft Manual of Style\\n\\n## Style Guide Validation\\n\\nFrameD can automatically validate your documentation against this style guide. To enable validation:\\n\\n```javascript\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  checks: {\\n    styleGuide: {\\n      enabled: true,\\n      ruleset: '.framed/style-rules.json'\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Common Issues\\n\\nHere are some common style issues to watch for:\\n\\n1. Inconsistent capitalization in headings\\n2. Mixed usage of first-person and second-person perspective\\n3. Unclear or vague instructions\\n4. Lack of code examples where needed\\n5.
