# Writing Rules

Effective documentation requires consistent writing that is clear, concise, and easy to understand. This page outlines the writing rules for DocuSanity documentation.

## Voice and Tone

- Use a friendly, professional tone
- Write in the second person ("you") when addressing the reader
- Avoid first-person plural ("we") unless referring to the DocuSanity team specifically
- Be direct and concise
- Use active voice whenever possible

## Capitalization

### Headings

- Use sentence case for all headings and titles
- Capitalize the first word and proper nouns only
- Example: "Getting started with DocuSanity" (not "Getting Started With DocuSanity")

### Interface Elements

- Capitalize names of interface elements exactly as they appear in the UI
- Example: "Click the Save button"

## Terminology

- Use consistent terminology throughout the documentation
- Refer to the [dictionary validation](/docs/dictionary-validation) for approved terms
- Avoid jargon and technical terms without explanation
- Define acronyms on first use

## Grammar and Punctuation

- Use Oxford commas in lists (a, b, and c)
- Use em dashes (â€”) for breaks in thought, not hyphens or double hyphens
- Keep sentences short and focused on a single idea
- Limit paragraphs to 3-5 sentences on average

## Examples

### Poor Example:

\`\`\`
When we're setting up the config file you'll want to make sure that all your settings are correct because if they aren't your validation might not work correctly and you'll get errors when you run the checks on your documentation which will be frustrating.
\`\`\`

### Improved Example:

\`\`\`
Set up your configuration file carefully. Incorrect settings may cause validation errors when you run checks on your documentation.
\`\`\`

## Special Cases

### Code References

When referring to code elements:

- Use code formatting (\`element\`) for all code references
- Use proper capitalization for language-specific elements
- Example: "Use the \`useState\` hook in React components"

### Links

- Make link text descriptive of the destination
- Avoid generic link text like "click here" or "read more"
- Example: "Review the [installation guide](/docs/installation)" instead of "click [here](/docs/installation) for installation"
