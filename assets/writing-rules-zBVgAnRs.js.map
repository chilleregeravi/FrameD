Incorrect settings may cause validation errors when you run checks on your documentation.\\n```\\n\\n## Special Cases\\n\\n### Code References\\n\\nWhen referring to code elements:\\n\\n- Use code formatting (`element`) for all code references\\n- Use proper capitalization for language-specific elements\\n- Example: \\\"Use the `useState` hook in React components\\\"\\n\\n### Links\\n\\n- Make link text descriptive of the destination\\n- Avoid generic link text like \\\"click here\\\" or \\\"read more\\\"\\n- Example: \\\"Review the [installation guide](/docs/installation)\\\" instead of \\\"click [here](/docs/installation) for installation\\\"\\n\\n## Additional Resources\\n\\n- [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style)\\n- [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/style-guide/)\\n- [The Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/)\\n\""],"names":["writingRules"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAeA,EAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;"}
